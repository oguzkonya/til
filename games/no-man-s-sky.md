# No Man's Sky

- You can buy new slots for your exosuit in Space Stations and Space Anomaly. Not only inventory slots, but also technology and cargo slots, too.
- You can fly faster if you tap `Q` before hitting the jetpack.
- You can change the size of the terrain manipulator by tapping `R` or `T`. You can mine more resources from resource deposits if you use the smallest beam.
- You can produce infinite `Di-hydrogen` with 40 `Di-hydrogen` and a `Refiner`:
    1. Use 40 `Di-hydrogen` to craft a `Di-hydrogen Jelly`.
    2. Refine the `Di-hydrogen Jelly` to produce 50 `Di-hydrogen`.
    3. Repeat steps 1 and 2, to produce 10 `Di-Hydrogen` per cycle.
- `Tritium` can be found easily in asteroids in space. With `Tritium` and `Di-hydrogen` you can refine `Frigate Fuel` which is not only needed for space exploration, but also quite expensive and a good source of income.
- `Gold Nugget`'s sell value is 3280 units but when analyzed it yields an average of 61.5 `Gold`. One `Gold` is worth 353 units, so the `Gold` that is obtained from analyzing a `Gold Nugget` has a higher sell value.
- The same can't be said for `Tritium Hypercluster`. It's sell value is 3280 units while it yields an average of 107 `Tritium` when analyzed (one `Tritium` is worth 6 units).
- If sentinels are chasing you, going into space wouldn't make them back off. Sentinel starships would spawn in waves, and they would drop highly valuable material when killed.
