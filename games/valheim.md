# Valheim

- Falling logs can kill you
- You can split item stacks via Shift click
- Flint can be easily found on river beds
- If you are playing co-op, hit M to open up the map and make sure "Visible to other players" is selected
- You can place markers on the map with clicking the icons on the lower right corner and then double clicking on the map
- Build a campfire and a bed (and then claim it) as soon as possible to create a spawn point
- You can put your campfire in your base, but you can only put it directly on the ground (no floor tiles), and you need to build a chimney because smoke can accumulate and kill you.
- Eat food to increase your health temporarily and get bonuses to your stats
- You can eat 3 types of food (and one each) at a time
- You can level the terrain with a Hoe. It brings the height down to your feet.
- If you can't level a terrain no matter what you try, it means there's a rock under there. You need to break it with a pickaxe.
- When building your base, you may notice that sections change color. That color indicates structural support: blue means solid, green means good support, yellow means the structure is weakening, orange means very weak, red means you can't build at all. Use beams to support your structure.
- You can stack chests. Place a chest close to the wall and then place a 1x1 floor tile just above the chest. You can place another chest on that tile.
